    summary: `Fiberarmering och efterspänning är väletablerade tekniker inom byggbranschen; de kombineras dock sällan, 
    troligtvis mest beroende på att fiberarmering inte är inkluderat i gällande Europeisk standard (EuroCode). Under det 
    senaste decenniet har förberedande arbete gjorts inom CEN (CEN ansvarar för EuroCode) för att fiberarmering ska inkluderas 
    i nästa generation av EuroCode. Nästa generation av EuroCode kommer att börja gälla vid årsskiftet 2022/2023, vilket leder 
    till en ökad användning av teknikerna i kombination.
    Det råder en brist på erfarenheter och kunskap av fiberarmering (FRC) och efterspänning i kombination. Beräkningar baserade 
    på konstruktionernas bärförmåga och materialtyper finns men ytterligare utvärdering av fiberns kapacitet tillsammans med 
    efterspänning är viktig för att entreprenören ska kunna göra produktivitets och materialvinster. Att kombinera FRC och 
    efterspänning tros ge betydande förbättringar i byggtider, minskning av betongvolymer, lägre byggkostnader och ökad 
    hållbarhet över hela bygglivscykeln och värdekedjan. Det kan också leda till förbättringar av hälsa och säkerhet i 
    branschen genom att minska behovet av traditionella arbetsintensiva processer, såsom hanteringen av traditionell armering.`,

    summary: `Since the early 1990s, several SBUF projects have been carried out with a focus on concrete structures during curing and the risk of thermal cracking. Computer programs and aids/tools have also been developed to assess the stress and cracking risk of concrete structures during curing. However, no systematic review of the state of knowledge (State-Of-The-Art) has been conducted in the last 20 years; the most recent one was carried out within the SBUF and Brite/EuRam-funded project IPACS. A State-Of-The-Art report was published in 2011 in Norway, and the Norwegian Concrete Association published a guide in 2021. In Denmark, temperature cracks were investigated within the "HETEK" project in the late 90s, and testing methods and material models were presented. The primary purpose of the project is to, through an environmental analysis of methods and tools used, determine the nature of concrete during curing. The analysis will lead to a report highlighting Swedish needs for research and development of methods and tools. Increased knowledge of hardening concrete's cracking risk-related properties is of the utmost importance for the construction industry as the need for understanding and the robustness of the industry's approach and procedure has increased significantly recently.`,

    summary: `Ensuring the integrity and serviceability of our transport infrastructure 
        is vital for the development and welfare of society. Consequently, guaranteeing 
        the serviceability of our infrastructure by condition assessment and proper 
        maintenance is imperative. Yet today, condition assessment strategies rely on 
        labour-intensive on-site inspections, providing limited and subjective data. 
        Particularly, the detection of corrosion processes in a structure is one of the 
        degradation mechanisms where largest uncertainties exist. In this project, 
        we will develop novel sensor-driven supported strategies based on distributed 
        optical fiber sensing (DOFS) to promote a digital upgrade of the current condition 
        assessment methods. By combining experimental data from cutting-edge DOFS and the 
        latest advancements in modelling techniques, we will provide autonomous real-time 
        damage detection through thorough and accurate descriptions of the internal damage 
        due to corrosion. This information is the backbone for the current state-of-the-art 
        assessment models. This will lead to a better planning of resources, the possibility 
        to study optimal repair solutions and the application of timely preventive measures. 
        As a result, the service-life of our infrastructure will be effectively extended 
        while on-site inspections will be minimized, thereby enabling a better use of our 
        limited resources while causing a lower impact to the users, with the consequent 
        environmental and economic savings for society.`,

    summary: `Monitoring of tunnels during construction is vital to increase the safety

                             of the structure. In hard rock conditions, shotcrete in combination with rock bolts
                             is the most commonly used support system, where the rock bolts fasten larger rock blocks
                             to the underlying rock and the shotcrete lining is subjected to block loads and loos rock
                             mass occuring between rock bolts. Conventional monitoring techniques used today such as
                             total stations, inclinometers and strain gauges offer discrete measurement points which
                             are used monitor convergence and pointwise utilization of strains in the lining. However,
                             the conventional monitoring techniques are not capable of detecting loads on the shotcrete
                             lining and due to few discrete measurement points, the convergence is often require
                             interpolation over large distances. By installing Distributed Optical Fibre Sensors in
                             the shotcrete lining, distributed strain profiles of the entire lining section can be
                             used to calculate a more precis convergence and loads acting on the lining can be
                             detected. Further, the project aims to develop a database including both experimental
                             and artificially generated data through non-linear finite element modelling, which
                             will be used to train a machine-learning algorithm that is able to predict and
                             assess the structural integrity of the shotcrete tunnel lining.`,

    summary: `Today, inspections of transport infrastructure and maintenance operations rely to a large extent on manual, analogue and fragmented processes which consequently make the current approach time consuming, inefficient and costly. A digital upgrade of the inspection protocols, methods, and workflows, which have not changed for decades, is urgently needed to increase the efficiency of on-site structural condition assessment. Together with industrial partners, Chalmers University is tackling this challenge by utilising the latest advancements in sensing technology together with the recent developments within the field of ICT. As part of the Chalmers research concept “Sensor driven cloud-based strategies for infrastructure management (SensIT)” we aim at developing a collaborative Augmented Reality (AR) tool for infrastructure inspection and maintenance. The tool will include functionalities to retrieve, analyse and visualise infrastructure data, as well as functionalities for on-site guided inspection and annotation, thereby greatly simplifying and optimizing the inspection process. The project will focus on the needs of end-users such as consultancies and the Swedish Transport Administration by actively engaging our partners in the design, evaluation and on-site testing of the AR tool. We believe that the here proposed integration of AR tools within a structural health monitoring framework has the potential to radically change the way inspections are done today. The digitisation of the entire information flow - BIM/GIS data, sensor data, in-situ simulation results, annotation, inspection history - will greatly reduce the time and costs of inspection processes and will guarantee a simplified and transparent workflow that even non-expert operators will be able to use.`,

    summary: `Understanding basic concepts and assumptions is a crucial step in the learning process of any subject, yet today it is not always achieved. A change of the current teaching method is suggested in this paper through the implementation of a new learning activity based on digital tools. The use of interactive tools has been shown to be an effective method in the field of medicine. Although less frequent, interactive tools could also be beneficial in the field of civil engineering, particularly in structural engineering, where real lab experiments are large, costly and time consuming. By building a small-scale interactive bridge model, the students can have access to a live experiment in the classroom, which enables them to put in practice the concepts learnt during the lectures. This tool seeks promoting a deeper understanding of the subject, thereby increasing the ability of the students to describe the different concepts and explain the physical meaning behind the analytical equations taught in structural engineering courses.`,
