      "Thanks to Trafikverket, and more specially to the energetic Anna Teike, we had the opportunity of putting aside our beloved and exiting lab, to go to the V채stl채nken site at Korsv채gen and deploy some of sensors in a critical column key for the functioning of teh structural system that will serve us during many years. Looking forward to start the measurements ;). Special thanks to the sensor specialist August and Anna to facilitate this to happen. More to come! <strong>Stay tuned!</strong> <em>/thesensitproject</em>",

      "Demo within the PostDOFS project, testing of a Postensioned Fiber Reinforcef Concrete beam",
    description:
      'In this demo we put toguether the different adavancements we have made in the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) solutions for structural engineering combined with top-notch monitoring based on Distributed Optic Fiber Sensors and top-leading post-processing algorithms for real-time analysis and visualization. The test was carried out in the context of a project funded by SBUF that consisted in a comparison of the new proposals for the used of FRC introduced in the Eurocodes aiming a more sustainable structural solutions. The test was held in the context of the SBUF council visit to Chalmers University and a seminar within our centre <em>"konstruktionscentrum"</em> that strives for the promotion of our beloved profession. In the demo an 8.5 meters Postensioned Fiber Reinforced beam was tested to failure under a four-point bending configurarion, which benefits of a constant moment central region within loading points. During the test cyclic loads where introduced and the behaviour of the beam was shown through our AR app, framework taht offers the posibility of real-time tracking and visualisation of crack onset and development, deflection and strain distribution along the element. Making the invisible visible. More than 30 attendess could enjoy a singular and changelling test in our leading structural lab at Chalmers University of Technology that enforced us to the limit to coordinate all parts toguether, seamelessly working.
